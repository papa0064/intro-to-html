            <p>Hi! My name is— well, you’ve probably figured out my name by now. I’m a first-year Graphic Design student studying at Algonquin College in Ottawa. Though this is my first year in Graphic Design, this isn’t my first year at Algonquin, as I spent two semesters in the Design Foundations program from 2024–25. I was drawn to graphic design as a way to pursue my passion for visual arts while ensuring a stable income in the future. Additionally, the program offers courses applicable to a wide variety of fields. Even if I decide that graphic design isn’t for me, I can be confident that the skills I learned will be useful somewhere else.</p>

            <p>Considering my choice of career, you may find it surprising to learn that I rarely spend time making art outside of class. Ironically, this was also a key factor that led to me studying graphic design. As much as I enjoy drawing and making art, I find that I need a <em>reason</em> to create if I’m going to put my time into it, and “just for fun” is rarely motivating enough. But by making art my work, it can make my work something to look forward to. Many have spoken on the pitfalls of making something you love into your career; when money is on the line it adds a new layer of stress to what you love, and you may even grow to hate it. Thus, I believe that it’s exactly <em>because</em> I don’t create art in my free time that this field will be so fulfilling for me, since it gives me the opportunity to do something I enjoy that I otherwise never put time into.</p>
